# IcePick
IcePick offers a highly accurate, simple method of scraping. It's a new way to scrape HTML - sorting by structure instead of classes and IDs.

## What do I use IcePick for?

I scrape social media data in my webapp [Harrow Search](https://harrowsearch.com). **IcePick is instrumental in scraping Facebook** because of the myriad of similarly structured data items that appear on the site. (The Facebook API does not offer what I need, no. IcePick helped me construct an ad hoc API!)

## Usage

Check out the [IcePick documentation README](https://github.com/jack-michaud/IcePick/blob/master/docs/README.md) for an example of scraping the Python docs.
